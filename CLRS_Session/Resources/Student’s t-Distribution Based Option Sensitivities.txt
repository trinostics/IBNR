Cassidy, Daniel & J. Hamp, Michael & Ouyed, Rachid. (2010). Student's t-Distribution Based Option Sensitivities: Greeks for the Gosset Formulae. Quantitative Finance. 13. 10.1080/14697688.2012.744087. European options can be priced when returns follow a Student's t-distribution, provided that the asset is capped in value or the distribution is truncated. We call pricing of options using a log Student's t-distribution a Gosset approach, in honour of W.S. Gosset. In this paper, we compare the greeks for Gosset and Black-Scholes formulae and we discuss implementation. The t-distribution requires a shape parameter \nu to match the "fat tails" of the observed returns. For large \nu, the Gosset and Black-Scholes formulae are equivalent. The Gosset formulae removes the requirement that the volatility be known, and in this sense can be viewed as an extension of the Black-Scholes formula. Comment: 28 pages, 14 figures and 6 tables.
