Twenty-five years ago Mack (“Distribution Free”) and Murphy (“Unbiased LDFs”) published algorithms for estimating the uncertainty of chainladder projections. I don’t know about Mack, but Murphy is wondering why nothing seems to have happened since. Perhaps it is because few actuaries have the tools to get their hands dirty in this exciting area of actuarial analysis. This session will reintroduce the regression perspective to the chainladder time-series model. Appropriately prepared attendees with the installed open-source software will be able to participate as we apply the model using the R ChainLadder package to summarized triangles as well as the underlying claim detail. We will investigate questions such as - What are the differences between the parameter and process risk components? Do the two applications model the same or different results? We will see how technology allows for rich predictive modeling possibilities when the actuary has access to more detailed development data.
